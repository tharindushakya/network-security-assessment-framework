git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-assessment-framework.git
cd network-security-assessment-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

```python
from nsaf import NetworkScanner, VulnerabilityScanner, ReportGenerator

# Initialize scanner
scanner = NetworkScanner()
vuln_scanner = VulnerabilityScanner()

# Perform network scan
targets = scanner.discover_hosts("192.168.1.0/24")
scan_results = scanner.port_scan(targets)

# Run vulnerability assessment
vuln_results = vuln_scanner.assess(scan_results)

# Generate report
report = ReportGenerator()
report.generate_html_report(vuln_results, "security_assessment.html")
```
