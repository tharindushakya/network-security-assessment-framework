2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-assessment-framework.git
   cd network-security-assessment-framework
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use `black` for code formatting:
  ```bash
  black nsaf/
  ```
- Use `isort` for import sorting:
  ```bash
  isort nsaf/
  ```
- Use `flake8` for linting:
  ```bash
  flake8 nsaf/
  ```

### Type Hints

- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Run `mypy` for type checking:
  ```bash
  mypy nsaf/
  ```

### Documentation

- Document all public functions and classes
- Use docstrings following Google style
- Update README.md for significant changes

### Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Run the full test suite:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=nsaf tests/
  ```

## üîÑ Contribution Process

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/network-security-assessment-framework/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

### 3. Make Changes

- Make your changes in small, logical commits
- Write clear commit messages
- Follow the coding standards
- Add or update tests as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

Run the full test suite and ensure all tests pass:
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=nsaf

# Run type checking
mypy nsaf/

# Run linting
flake8 nsaf/

# Format code
black nsaf/
isort nsaf/
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link any related issues
5. Wait for review and address feedback

### Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email us privately at security@nsaf.project
3. Provide detailed description
4. Allow time for fix before disclosure
