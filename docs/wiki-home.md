## Overview

The Network Security Assessment Framework (NSAF) is a comprehensive Python-based toolkit designed to automate network security assessments. It provides:

- **Network Discovery**: Multiple host discovery techniques
- **Port Scanning**: TCP/UDP scanning with service detection
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Automated security vulnerability detection
- **Report Generation**: Professional reports in multiple formats
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for custom extensions

## Key Features

### 🌐 Network Discovery
- Ping sweeps with customizable parameters
- ARP scanning for local network discovery
- TCP SYN probes for stealthy discovery
- Custom host discovery methods

### 🔌 Port Scanning
- TCP connect scanning for accuracy
- TCP SYN scanning for speed (requires privileges)
- UDP scanning for comprehensive coverage
- Service fingerprinting and version detection
- Banner grabbing and analysis

### 🚨 Vulnerability Assessment
- **Protocol Vulnerabilities**: Detection of insecure protocols (Telnet, FTP, etc.)
- **SSL/TLS Assessment**: Cipher strength, protocol versions, certificate validation
- **Web Application Testing**: Directory traversal, security headers, exposed files
- **Service-Specific Checks**: Database exposure, SSH configuration, etc.
- **Configuration Analysis**: Security misconfigurations and weaknesses

### 📊 Report Generation
- **HTML Reports**: Interactive, professional-looking reports
- **PDF Reports**: Executive summaries and technical details
- **JSON/CSV**: Machine-readable formats for integration
- **Custom Templates**: Extensible reporting system

## Architecture

NSAF is built with a modular architecture:

```
nsaf/

│   ├── scanner.py              # Network scanning functionality
│   ├── vulnerability_scanner.py # Vulnerability assessment
│   └── report_generator.py     # Report generation
├── utils/
│   ├── logger.py              # Logging utilities
│   └── config.py              # Configuration management
└── examples/                  # Usage examples
```

## Installation Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Privileges**: Some features require elevated privileges
- **Dependencies**: Automatically installed via pip

## Quick Start

1. **Install NSAF**:
   ```bash
   pip install nsaf
   ```

2. **Basic Network Scan**:
   ```bash
   nsaf scan -t 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

3. **Comprehensive Assessment**:
   ```bash
   nsaf assess -t 192.168.1.100 --vuln-scan --all-reports
   ```

4. **Python API Usage**:
   ```python
   from nsaf import NetworkScanner, VulnerabilityScanner, ReportGenerator
   
   scanner = NetworkScanner()
   hosts = scanner.discover_hosts("192.168.1.0/24")
   results = scanner.port_scan(hosts)
   ```
